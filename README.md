# Extruder for 3D printers that use 1.75mm filament 

Designed to use Mk7 drive gear directly driven by a NEMA 17 stepper motor.

Loosely based on airtripper extruder.

Use an M3 tap to cut a thread in top of extruder body for push-fit.

Assembly should be fairly self explanatory.

Cut a block of foam 20mm cube and run a cut vertically through the middle. Push it over the filament going through the cleaner.

Photo of assembled extruder coming shortly.
