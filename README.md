# Extruder for 3D printers that use 1.75mm filament 

Designed to use Mk7 drive gear directly driven by a NEMA 17 stepper motor.

Can be mounted vertically or slightly angled for straighter feed from filament spool.

Quick and easy filament change without changing idler tension.

Loosely based on airtripper extruder.

Use an M5 tap to cut a thread in top of extruder body for push-fit.

Assembly should be fairly self explanatory.

Cut a block of foam 20mm cube and run a cut vertically through the middle. Push it over the filament going through the cleaner housing.

Use photos of assembled extruder for reference.
